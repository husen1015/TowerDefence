# TowerDefence

tower defense game implemented in unity using C#  scripting inspired by the tutorial series by Brackeys youtube channel
TODO 
- add graphical enhancements (effects, trees, boulders...)
- add at least two new levels each with their own different layout
- find interesting enemy assets instead of just using plain spheres
- add audio to the game
